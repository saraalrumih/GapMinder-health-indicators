# GapMinder-health-indicators
In this project, we are going to use python to investigate 4 GapMinder indicators related to the health field in the 6 Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain). The selected indicators are as follows:
1. Medical doctors: The number of medical doctors per 1000 person per year.
2. Child mortality: The total death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births.
3. Life expectancy: The average number of years a new born child would live if the current mortality pattern stayed the same.
4. Government spendings in the health sector: The amount of dollars spent in health per person per year.

The project contains the following:
- Jupyter notebook.
- 4 csv data files (file for each indicator)
